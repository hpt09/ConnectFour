The Grid class represents a vertically suspended 2D grid of cells in a Connect Four game. Each player may insert discs
into the top of the grid, where they will fall vertically (due to gravity) to rest on top of the other discs already
stacked in that column.

The Grid size can be specified at construction. If the grid dimensions are N x M (rows x columns), the top row of the
grid where players insert discs is row 0, while the bottom row of the Grid is row (N-1). The left-most column is column
0, while the right-most column is colum (M-1).

Each cell of the grid will be represented by the Cell enum. Each cell can be either empty or occupied by a disc owned by
one of the two players currently playing.
