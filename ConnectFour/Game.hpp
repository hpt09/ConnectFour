/*
The game class oversees all game logic and state. Once a game is created it must be assigned two players and a grid
before it is playable. The game starts with Player One's turn. Each time playNextTurn is called the current player's
turn is executed, with each player taking turns alternately. Each time a Player wins, their score and win counters
should be incremented, and both player's scored should be reset when the Game is restarted.

When the Game class is destroyed, it should delete any assigned Grid. The Game does not own assigned Players, so it
should never try to delete them.

    be reached either by one player winning, or a draw being reached (no more moves can be made). The `winner` method of
    the Game can be used to determine whether a game was won or drawn.
